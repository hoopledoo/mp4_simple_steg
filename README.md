# mp4_simple_steg

These were some simple scripts created to tweak an mp4 file,
by updating the content chunk offsets and inserting
arbitrary data into the mdat section of an mp4 file.

This code has not been tested thoroughly,
and it was created with the intention for one-time
use in a toy data hiding experiment.
